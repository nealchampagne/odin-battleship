# Odin Battleship

## Description

This is my implementation of the Battleship TDD capstone project from the Javascript Course of the Odin Project's Full Stack Javascript curriculum.

This was my first time using TDD principles to guide the process of writing my three object factories. I used Jest to build incremental tests that ensured my code worked as expected and that any subsequent tweaks wouldn't break anything that came before without me noticing.

My implementation uses a simple point-and-click interface to allow players to place their ships and attack the opponent's board. A two-player mode is made possible by an interstitial styling that keeps both boards hidden between alternating player turns.

This project represented the first time I implemented any sort of "AI" opponent logic that wasn't purely random. It also introduced me to some of the logical limitations of importing, manipulating, and passing data structures between modules in JavaScript.

I ran into and overcame several challenges over the course of this project that have made me a significantly better developer.
